This project was created to serve as a client for the following project (https://github.com/GabrielBarrosAS/spring-web-flux-studies). The idea is to replicate the consumed service to simulate two different data sources, in order to be able to analyze the impacts of using spring webflux in the service application. The consumed service: (https://github.com/GabrielBarrosAS/spring-web-flux-studies) is still in the process of being tweaked locally to make the idea of the approach clearer. However, they will be two identical spring-boot applications for the most part, but they will query the database with different filters, resulting in a different response time, thus making it possible to visualize the competition proposed by webflux.
